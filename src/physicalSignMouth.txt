Baring one's teeth
Biting finger
Biting lips
Breathing excessively
Clenched jaw
Coughing
Curling lip
Downturned mouth
Grimacing
Gritting teeth
Lips that flatten
Mouth wide open
Open mouth
Poking one's tongue into the cheek
Pressing lips tight
Sighing
Smile that slips or appears forced
Smiling
Smirking
Spitting
Sticking tongue out
Swallowing hard
Taking a deep breath and holding it in
Yawning
