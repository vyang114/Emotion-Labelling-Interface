Averted gaze
Avoiding eye contact
Baring one's teeth
Beads of sweat on the lip or forehead
Biting lips
Blank look, a slack expression
Chin dipping down
Closed eyes
Curling lip
Dark circles under the eyes
Downcast eyes
Ears turning red
Expression that appears pained
Eyebrows that squish together
Eyes appearing damp and overly bright
Eyes that appear cold, dead and flat
Flaring their nostrils
Flat expression
Frowning
Furrowed eyebrows
Gaze clouding, going distant
Glancing as if looking for answers
Glaring
Glassy stare
Grimacing
Gritting one's teeth and pressing the lips tight
High chin
Looking away
Looking behind
Looking down
Lowered eyebrows
Mouth opens but nothing comes out
Narrowed eyes
Open mouth and tongue pushing slightly forward
Pale complexion
Pinched expression
Pinching the bridge of one's nose
Poking one's tongue into the cheek
Puffing out the cheeks
Raising one's eyebrows
Running makeup
Smile that slips or appears forced
Squeezing eyes shut
Squinting eyes
