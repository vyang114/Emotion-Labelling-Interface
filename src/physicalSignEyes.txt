Averted gaze
Avoiding eye contact
Closed eyes
Dark circles under the eyes
Downcast eyes
Empty stare
Eyebrows squishing together
Eyes are damp and bright
Eyes are cold, dead and flat
Eyes wide open
Frowning
Furrowed eyebrows
Gaze clouding, going distant
Glaring
Looking away
Looking behind
Looking down
Looking sideway
Looking up
Lowered eyebrows
Narrowed eyes
Peeking
Raising eyebrows
Rolling eyes
Side-eyeing
Staring down at empty hands
Staring down at the ground
Staring off into the distance
Squeezing eyes shut
Squinting eyes
Unfocused gaze
